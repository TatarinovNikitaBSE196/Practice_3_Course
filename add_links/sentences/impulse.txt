	in this chapter we will deal with systems of two or more objects, and—towardthe end of the chapter—the concept of center of mass.contents7–1 momentum and its relation to force7–2 conservation of momentum7–3 collisions and impulse7–4 conservation of energy andmomentum in collisions7–5 elastic collisions in onedimension7–6 inelastic collisions*7–7 collisions in two dimensions7–8 center of mass (cm)*7–9 cm for the human body*7–10 cm and translational motion7chapterconservation of linear momentum is another great conservation law of physics.collisions, such as between billiard or pool balls, illustrate this law very nicely: the total vector momentum just before the collision equals the total vector momentum just after the collision.

	section 7–4177ff0tittftδfigure 7;10 the average force acting over a very brief time interval gives the same impulseas the actual force.
	we multiply both sides of thisequation by the time interval and obtain(7;4)the quantity on the left, the product of the force times the time over whichthe force acts, is called the impulse:(7;5)we see that the total change in momentum is equal to the impulse.
	the conceptof impulse is useful mainly when dealing with forces that act during a short timeinterval, as when a bat hits a baseball.
	estimate the impulse and theaverage force delivered by a karate blow that breaks a board (fig.
	the hand’s mass should probably includepart of the arm, and we take it to be roughlysolution the impulse equals the change in momentumwe can obtain the force if we know the hand is brought to rest over the dis-tance of roughly a centimeter:the average speed during theimpact is  and equals thus  or 2 ms. the average force is thus (eq.

	in a collision, two (or more) objectsinteract with each other over a very short time interval, and theforce each exerts on the other during this time interval is verylarge compared to any other forces acting.the impulse delivered by a force on an object is defined as (7;5)where is the average force acting during the (usually veryshort) time interval the impulse is equal to the change inmomentum of the object:(7;4)total momentum is conserved in any collision as long asany net external force is zero or negligible.

	7–4, the longer the impact time of animpulse, the smaller the force can be for the same momentumchange, and hence the smaller the deformation of the objecton which the force acts.
	is it possible for an object to receive a larger impulse from asmall force than from a large force?

	(ii) a golf ball of mass 0.045 kg is hit off the tee at a speedof the golf club was in contact with the ball forfind (a) the impulse imparted to the golf ball,and (b) the average force exerted on the ball by the golf club.17.
	calculate (a) the original momentum of the fullback, (b) the impulse exerted on the fullback, (c) theimpulse exerted on the tackler, and (d) the average forceexerted on the tackler.22.

	(iii) (a) calculate the impulse experienced when a 55-kgperson lands on firm ground after jumping from a heightof 2.8 m. (b) estimate the average force exerted on theperson’s feet by the ground if the landing is stiff-legged,and again (c) with bent legs.
	[hint: the average net force onhim, which is related to impulse,is the vector sum of gravity andthe force exerted by the ground.see fig.
