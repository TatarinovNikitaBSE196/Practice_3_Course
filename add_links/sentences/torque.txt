	8–4 torquewe have so far discussed rotational kinematics—the description of rotationalmotion in terms of angular position, angular velocity, and angular acceleration.now we discuss the dynamics, or causes, of rotational motion.
	this product is called the moment of the force about the axis, or, more commonly, it is called the torque, and is represented by (greeklowercase letter tau).
	thus, the angular acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net applied torque and we see that it is torque that gives rise to angular acceleration.

	the magnitude of the torque associated with is then this short leverarm and the corresponding smaller torque associated with are consistentwith the observation that is less effective in accelerating the door than is with its larger lever arm.
	8–12 that the lineof action of the force passes through the hinge, and hence its lever arm is zero.consequently, zero torque is associated with and it gives rise to no angularacceleration, in accord with everyday experience (you can’t get a door to startmoving by pushing directly at the hinge).in general, then, we can write the magnitude of the torque about a given axis as(8;10a)where is the lever arm, and the perpendicular symbol reminds us that wemust use the distance from the axis of rotation that is perpendicular to the line ofaction of the force (fig.
	8–13a).an equivalent way of determining the torque associated with a force is toresolve the force into components parallel and perpendicular to the line that con-nects the axis to the point of application of the force, as shown in fig.
	thecomponent exerts no torque since it is directed at the rotation axis (its leverarm is zero).
	hence the torque will be equal to times the distance r from theaxis to the point of application of the force:(8;10b)this gives the same result as eq.

228

	which force exerts the greater torque:or both the same?when more than one torque acts on an object, the angular acceleration isfound to be proportional to the net torque.
	if all the torques acting on an objecttend to rotate it in the same direction about a fixed axis of rotation, the nettorque is the sum of the torques.
	but if, say, one torque acts to rotate an object in one direction, and a second torque acts to rotate the object in the oppositedirection, the net torque is the difference of the two torques.
	we normally assigna positive sign to torques that act to rotate the object counterclockwise (just as is usually positive counterclockwise), and a negative sign to torques that actto rotate the object clockwise.forces that act to tilt the axiswe have been considering only rotation about a fixed axis, and so we considered onlyforces that act in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation.
	8–16), in a plane perpen-dicular to the axis will give rise to rotational acceleration about the axis.8–5 rotational dynamics;torque and rotational inertiawe discussed in section 8–4 that the angular acceleration of a rotating object isproportional to the net torque applied to it:we write to remind us that it is the net torque (sum of all torques acting on the object) that is proportional to this corresponds to newton’s second law for translational motion,in the translational case, the acceleration isnot only proportional to the net force, but it is also inversely proportional to theinertia of the object, which we call its mass, m. thus we wrote .
	consider a force f that acts on the mass m tangent to the circle as shown.the torque that gives rise to an angular acceleration is if we use newton’ssecond law for linear quantities,and eq.
	8–5 relating the angularacceleration to the tangential linear acceleration,then we havewhen we multiply both sides of this equation by r, we find that the torque or[single particle] (8;11)here at last we have a direct relation between the angular acceleration and theapplied torque the quantity represents the rotational inertia of the particleand is called its moment of inertia.mr2t.t = mr2a.t = rf = r(mra),= mra.f = maatan = ra,©f = ma,t = rf.©f = ma.a r ©ta = ©f�ma r ©f.a.©ta r ©t.tafb⊥fb∑∑*uafb,fa,fbbfa = 30 nfb = 20 n208chapter 8rotational motion30°axisbfbafbfigure 8;15 exercise b.axis ofrotation⊥||fbfbfbfigure 8;16 only the componentof that acts in the plane perpen-dicular to the rotation axis,acts to accelerate the wheel about the axis.the component parallel to the axis,would tend to move the axisitself, which we assume is held fixed.fb∑∑ ,fb⊥,fbrmcfbfigure 8;17 a mass m revolvingin a circle of radius r about a fixedpoint c.

235

	8–14 can be written as can also be written interms of angular momentum:(8;19)where is the net torque acting to rotate the object, and is the change inangular momentum in a time interval equation 8–14,is a specialcase of eq.
	8–19 that if the net torque on an object is zero, then equals zero.
	this is the law of conservation of angular momentum fora rotating object:the total angular momentum of a rotating object remains constant if the nettorque acting on it is zero.the law of conservation of angular momentum is one of the great conservationlaws of physics, along with those for energy and linear momentum.when there is zero net torque acting on an object, and the object is rotatingabout a fixed axis or about an axis through its center of mass whose directiondoesn’t change, we can write(8;20)and are the moment of inertia and angular velocity, respectively, about thataxis at some initial time and i and are their values at some other time.the parts of the object may alter their positions relative to one another, so that ichanges.



236

	since the angular momentum remains constant(we ignore the small torque due to friction), if i decreases, then the angularvelocity must increase.
	the change inmoment of inertia from the straight position to the tuck position can be a factorof as much as note that for angular momentum to be conserved, the net torque must bezero; but the net force does not necessarily have to be zero.

	8–14,we see that if an object is to remain at rest, thenet torque applied to it (calculated about any axis) must be zero.
	thus we havethe second condition for equilibrium: that the sum of the torques acting on anobject, as calculated about any axis, must be zero:(9;2)this condition will ensure that the angular acceleration,about any axis will be zero.
	in such cases the torque is calculated about an axis that is perpen-dicular to the xy plane.

	in orderto pry the rock, the torque due to must at least balance the torque due to mg;that is,andwith r smaller, the weight mg can be balanced with less force the ratio is the mechanical advantage of the system.
	wewill mainly consider situations in which all the forces act in a plane, so we canhave two force equations (x and y components) and one torque equation, for atotal of three equations.
	when using a torque equation, a torque that tends to rotatethe object counterclockwise is usually considered positive, whereas a torque thattends to rotate it clockwise is considered negative.

	this makes sense: since she is lighter, she must sit farther from the pivot than the heavier child in order to provide torques of equal magnitude.exercise c we did not need to use the force equation to solve example 9–4 becauseof our choice of the axis.

	if it is tipped slightly, it will return to its original position due to the torque on it as shown in fig.
	when the cg is on one side, the torque pullsthe object back onto its original base of support, fig.
	if the object is tippedfurther, the cg goes past the pivot point and the torque causes the object to topple,fig.
	this is because the normal force upward on the object (which balancesout gravity) can be exerted only within the area of contact, so if the force of gravityacts beyond this area, a net torque will act to topple the object.stability, then, can be relative.

	from our description in section 20–10 of a simple dc motor, you might expectthat the armature would accelerate indefinitely due to the torque on it.

	the current will increase and may become large enough that thewindings of the motor heat up and may melt, ruining the motor.e r v,conceptual example 21;9counter torque, in a generatorin a generator, the situation is the reverse of that for a motor.
	because this current-carryingcoil is in an external magnetic field, there will be a torque exerted on it (as ina motor), and this torque opposes the motion (use right-hand-rule-2, page 568,for the force on a wire in fig.
	this is called a counter torque.the greater the electrical load—that is, the more current that is drawn—thegreater will be the counter torque.
	hence the external applied torque will have tobe greater to keep the generator turning.

	similarly, a generator actssomewhat like a motor in that a counter torque acts on itsrotating coil.a transformer, which is a device to change the magnitudeof an ac voltage, consists of a primary coil and a secondary coil.the changing flux due to an ac voltage in the primary coilinduces an ac voltage in the secondary coil.
