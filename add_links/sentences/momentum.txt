	in this chapterand the next, we discuss an alternative analysis of the translational motion ofobjects in terms of the quantities energy and momentum.
	the significance ofenergy and momentum is that they are conserved.
	that conserved quantities exist gives us not onlya deeper insight into the nature of the world, but also gives us another way toapproach solving practical problems.the conservation laws of energy and momentum are especially valuable indealing with systems of many objects, in which a detailed consideration of theforces involved would be difficult or impossible.

	in this chapter we discuss linearmomentum and its conservation.
	the law of conservation of momentum is essen-tially a reworking of newton’s laws that gives us tremendous physical insight andproblem-solving power.the law of conservation of momentum is particularly useful when dealing witha system of two or more objects that interact with each other, such as in collisionsof ordinary objects or nuclear particles.our focus up to now has been mainly on the motion of a single object, oftenthought of as a “particle” in the sense that we have ignored any rotation or internalmotion.
	in this chapter we will deal with systems of two or more objects, and—towardthe end of the chapter—the concept of center of mass.contents7–1 momentum and its relation to force7–2 conservation of momentum7–3 collisions and impulse7–4 conservation of energy andmomentum in collisions7–5 elastic collisions in onedimension7–6 inelastic collisions*7–7 collisions in two dimensions7–8 center of mass (cm)*7–9 cm for the human body*7–10 cm and translational motion7chapterconservation of linear momentum is another great conservation law of physics.collisions, such as between billiard or pool balls, illustrate this law very nicely: the total vector momentum just before the collision equals the total vector momentum just after the collision.
	after the collision, both balls move at angles, but the sum of their vector momenta equals the initial vector momentum of the incoming cue ball.we will consider both elastic collisions (where kinetic energy is also conserved) and inelastic collisions.

	7–1 momentum and its relation to forcethe linear momentum (or “momentum” for short) of an object is defined as theproduct of its mass and its velocity.
	momentum (plural is momenta—from latin) isrepresented by the symbol if we let m represent the mass of an object and represent its velocity, then its momentum is defined as(7;1)velocity is a vector, so momentum too is a vector.
	the direction of the momentumis the direction of the velocity, and the magnitude of the momentum is  because velocity depends on the reference frame, so does momentum; thus the ref-erence frame must be specified.
	the unit of momentum is that of which in si units is there is no special name for this unit.everyday usage of the term momentum is in accord with the definition above.according to eq.
	7–1, a fast-moving car has more momentum than a slow-movingcar of the same mass; a heavy truck has more momentum than a small car movingwith the same speed.
	the more momentum an object has, the harder it is to stopit, and the greater effect it will have on another object if it is brought to rest bystriking that object.
	a football player is more likely to be stunned if tackled by aheavy opponent running at top speed than by a lighter or slower-moving tackler.a heavy, fast-moving truck can do more damage than a slow-moving motorcycle.exercise a can a small sports car ever have the same momentum as a large sport-utility vehicle with three times the sports car’s mass?
	newton origi-nally stated his second law in terms of momentum (although he called the productmv the “quantity of motion”).

	although the momentum of each of the two balls changes as a result of the collision, the sum of their momenta is found to be the samebefore as after the collision.
	if is the momentum of ball a and the momentum of ball b, both measured just before the collision, then the total momentum of the two balls before the collision is the vector sumimmediately after the collision, the balls each have a differentvelocity and momentum, which we designate by a “prime” on the velocity:and the total momentum after the collision is the vector sumno matter what the velocities and masses are, experimentsshow that the total momentum before the collision is the same as afterward,whether the collision is head-on or not, as long as no net external force acts:(7;3)that is, the total vector momentum of the system of two colliding balls is conserved:it stays constant.
	)although the law of conservation of momentum was discovered experimen-tally, it can be derived from newton’s laws of motion, which we now show.let us consider two objects of mass and that have momentaandbefore they collide and and after theycollide, as in fig.

	thegeneral statement of the law of conservation of momentum isthe total momentum of an isolated system of objects remains constant.by a system, we simply mean a set of objects that we choose, and which mayinteract with each other.
	however, if we include the earth inthe system, the total momentum of rock plus earth is conserved.
	)although the law of conservation of momentum follows from newton’ssecond law, as we have seen, it is in fact more general than newton’s laws.

	in the reference frameof the rocket before any fuel is ejected, the total momentum of rocket plus fuel is zero.
	when the fuel burns, the total momentum remains unchanged: the back-ward momentum of the expelled gases is just balanced by the forward momentumgained by the rocket itself (see fig.

	for anythe object is moving to theright (increasing x), whereas forthe object is moving to the left (towarddecreasing values of x).from conservation of momentum, we havebecause the collision is assumed to be elastic, kinetic energy is also conserved:we have two equations, so we can solve for two unknowns.
	if we know the massesand velocities before the collision, then we can solve these two equations for thevelocities after the collision,and we derive a helpful result by rewriting themomentum equation as(i)and we rewrite the kinetic energy equation asnoting that algebraically  we write this last equation as(ii)we divide eq.

	conservation of kineticenergy applies as well because we are told the collision is elastic.solution (a) the masses are equal  so conservation ofmomentum giveswe need a second equation, because there are two unknowns.we could use theconservation of kinetic energy equation, or the simpler eq.

	so again we use the conservation laws ofmomentum and of kinetic energy, and apply them to our system of two particles.solution we use the subscripts p for the proton and he for the heliumnucleus.

	8–8 angular momentum andits conservationthroughout this chapter we have seen that if we use the appropriate angularvariables, the kinematic and dynamic equations for rotational motion are anal-ogous to those for ordinary linear motion.
	we saw in the previous section,for example, that rotational kinetic energy can be written as which isanalogous to the translational kinetic energy,in like manner, the linearmomentum,has a rotational analog.
	it is called angular momentum, l.for a symmetrical object rotating about a fixed axis through the cm, the angularmomentum is(8;18)where i is the moment of inertia and is the angular velocity about the axis ofrotation.
	the si units for l are which has no special name.we saw in chapter 7 (section 7–1) that newton’s second law can be writtennot only as but also more generally in terms of momentum (eq.
	8–14 can be written as can also be written interms of angular momentum:(8;19)where is the net torque acting to rotate the object, and is the change inangular momentum in a time interval equation 8–14,is a specialcase of eq.
	8–14.angular momentum is an important concept in physics because, under certain conditions, it is a conserved quantity.
	this is the law of conservation of angular momentum fora rotating object:the total angular momentum of a rotating object remains constant if the nettorque acting on it is zero.the law of conservation of angular momentum is one of the great conservationlaws of physics, along with those for energy and linear momentum.when there is zero net torque acting on an object, and the object is rotatingabout a fixed axis or about an axis through its center of mass whose directiondoesn’t change, we can write(8;20)and are the moment of inertia and angular velocity, respectively, about thataxis at some initial time and i and are their values at some other time.the parts of the object may alter their positions relative to one another, so that ichanges.

	many interesting phenomena can be understood on the basis of conservationof angular momentum.
	since the angular momentum remains constant(we ignore the small torque due to friction), if i decreases, then the angularvelocity must increase.
	if the skater reduces her moment of inertia by a factorof 2, she will then rotate with twice the angular velocity.vivi = ©mr2,216chapter 8rotational motion(a)(b)ωi large,   smallωi small,   largefigure 8;27 a skater spinning onice, illustrating conservation of angularmomentum: (a) i is large and issmall; (b) i is smaller so is larger.vvfigure 8;28 a diver rotates fasterwhen arms and legs are tucked inthan when they are outstretched.angular momentum is conserved.mbmav1figure 8;29 example 8–14.exercise d when a spinning figure skater pulls in her arms, her moment of inertiadecreases; to conserve angular momentum, her angular velocity increases.

	what will happen if the teacher suddenly flipsthe bicycle wheel over so that it is spinning in the opposite direction?response we consider the system of turntable, teacher, and bicycle wheel.the total angular momentum initially is vertically upward.
	that is also whatthe system’s angular momentum must be afterward, since is conserved when there is no net torque.
	thus, if the wheel’s angular momentum after beingflipped over is downward, then the angular momentum of teacher plusturntable will have to be upward.
	we can safely predict that the teacher(and turntable) will begin revolving in the same direction the wheel was spinning originally.±2lb–lblblbconceptual example 8;16angular momentum, like linear momentum, is a vector quantity.
	for a sym-metrical object rotating about a symmetry axis (such as a wheel, cylinder, hoop,or sphere), we can write the vector angular momentum as(8;21)the angular velocity vector (and therefore also ) points along the axis of rota-tion in the direction given by the right-hand rule (fig.
	8–30b).the vector nature of angular momentum can be used to explain a number of interesting (and sometimes surprising) phenomena.
	another explanation (and this is the most useful analysis here) is that this is an example of the conservation ofangular momentum.
	if the person starts walking counterclockwise, the person’sangular momentum will point upward along the axis of rotation (remember how we defined the direction of using the right-hand rule).
	the magnitude ofthe person’s angular momentum will be where v is theperson’s speed (relative to the earth, not to the platform), r is his distance fromthe rotation axis, m is his mass, and is his moment of inertia if we considerhim a particle (mass concentrated at one point, eq.8–11).
	the platform rotates in theopposite direction, so its angular momentum points downward.
	if the total angular momentum of the system is initially zero (person and platform at rest),it will remain zero after the person starts walking.
	that is, the upward angularmomentum of the person just balances the oppositely directed downward angular momentum of the platform (fig.
	8–31b), so the total vector angularmomentum remains zero.

	it doesn’t.today, most physicists prefer not to use relativistic mass, so an object has onlyone mass (its rest mass), and it is only the momentum that increases with speed.whenever we talk about the mass of an object, we will always mean its restmass (a fixed value).
	as an object is accelerated to greater andgreater speeds, its momentum becomes larger and larger.
	indeed, if v were toequal c, the denominator in this equation would be zero, and the momentumwould be infinite.

	but a photon striking a tiny object like an electron transfers enough momentumto greatly change the electron’s motion and position in an unpredictable way.
	but a short wavelength corresponds to high frequency and largemomentumand the more momentum the photons have, the moremomentum they can give the object when they strike it.
	if we use photons oflonger wavelength, and correspondingly smaller momentum, the object’s motionwhen struck by the photons will not be affected as much.
