195

	but by making use of the conservation laws for momentum and energy,we can still determine a lot about the motion after a collision, given the motionbefore the collision.
	if the two objects arevery hard and no heat or other energy is produced in the collision, then the total kinetic energy of the two objects is the same after the collision as before.for the brief moment during which the two objects are in contact, some (or all) of the energy is stored momentarily in the form of elastic potential energy.



198

	the col-lision of two hard elastic balls, such as billiard balls, however, is very close tobeing perfectly elastic, and we often treat it as such.we do need to remember that even when kinetic energy is not conserved,the total energy is always conserved.collisions in which kinetic energy is not conserved are said to be inelasticcollisions.
	if we know the massesand velocities before the collision, then we can solve these two equations for thevelocities after the collision,and we derive a helpful result by rewriting themomentum equation as(i)and we rewrite the kinetic energy equation asnoting that algebraically  we write this last equation as(ii)we divide eq.

	section 7–5elastic collisions in one dimension179c a u t i o nrelative speeds (one dimension only)we can rewrite this equation asor[head-on (1-d) elastic collision] (7;7)this is an interesting result: it tells us that for any elastic head-on collision, therelative speed of the two objects after the collision  has the same magnitude(but opposite direction) as before the collision, no matter what the masses are.equation 7–7 was derived from conservation of kinetic energy for elastic collisions, and can be used in place of it.
	conservation of kineticenergy applies as well because we are told the collision is elastic.solution (a) the masses are equal  so conservation ofmomentum giveswe need a second equation, because there are two unknowns.we could use theconservation of kinetic energy equation, or the simpler eq.
	7–7 derived from it:we add these two equations and obtainand then subtract the two equations to obtainthat is, the balls exchange velocities as a result of the collision: ball b acquiresthe velocity that ball a had before the collision, and vice versa.

	assume the collision takes place in nearly empty space.approach like example 7–7, this is an elastic head-on collision, but now themasses of our two particles are not equal.
	the only external force could be earth’s gravity, but it is insignificant compared to the powerful forces between the two particles at the moment of collision.
	from conservation of momentum,because the collision is elastic, the kinetic energy of our system of two particles isconserved and we can use eq.
	7–7, which becomesthusand substituting this into our momentum equation displayed above, we getsolving for we obtainthe other unknown is which we can now obtain fromthe minus sign for tells us that the proton reverses direction upon collision,and we see that its speed is less than its initial speed (see fig.

	two colliding balls of putty that stick togetheror two railroad cars that couple together when they collide are examples of com-pletely inelastic collisions.
	the kinetic energy in some cases is all transformed toother forms of energy in an inelastic collision, but in other cases only part of it is.in example 7–3, for instance, we saw that when a traveling railroad car collidedwith a stationary one, the coupled cars traveled off with some kinetic energy.
	in acompletely inelastic collision, the maximum amount of kinetic energy is transformedto other forms consistent with conservation of momentum.
	even though kineticenergy is not conserved in inelastic collisions, the total energy is always conserved,and the total vector momentum is also conserved.

	(usually, m is somewhat greater than m.) as a resultof the collision, the pendulum and projectile together swing up to a maximumheight h, fig.
	thekinetic energy immediately after the collision is changed entirely to gravitationalpotential energy when the pendulum reaches its maximum height, h.solution in part (1) momentum is conserved:(i)where is the speed of the block and embedded projectile just after the colli-sion, before they have moved significantly.in part (2), mechanical energy is conserved.
	but in part (1), because the collision is inelastic, theconservation of mechanical energy is not valid.
	then in part (2), conservation of mechanical energy is valid, but not conservation of momentum.note, however, that if there had been significant motion of the pendulumduring the deceleration of the projectile in the block, then there would havebeen an external force (gravity) during the collision, so conservation of momen-tum would not have been valid in part (1).v = m + mmv¿ = m + mm22gh,v¿v¿ = 22gh.v¿:12 (m + m)v¿2+   0 = 0+   (m + m)gh.

	if the collision is elastic, you can also write down aconservation of kinetic energy equation:[alternatively, you could use eq.



209

	but this may not be helpfulunless kinetic energy is conserved, in which case the collision iscalled an elastic collision and we can write(7;6)if kinetic energy is not conserved, the collision is calledinelastic.macroscopic collisions are generally inelastic.a completely inelastic collision is one in which the collidingobjects stick together after the collision.the center of mass (cm) of an extended object (or group ofobjects) is that point at which the net force can be consideredto act, for purposes of determining the translational motion ofthe object as a whole.

	at these extremely high temperatures, well above high-energycollisions can cause the breaking apart of iron and nickel nuclei into he nuclei,and eventually into protons and neutrons:these are energy-requiring (endothermic) reactions, which rob energy from thecore, allowing gravitational contraction to begin.

	when the average kinetic energy of particles was somewhat higher than1 gev, protons, neutrons, and their antiparticles were continually being createdout of the energies of collisions involving photons and other particles, such asbut just as quickly, particles and antiparticles would annihilate: for exampleso the processes of creation and annihilation of nucleons were in equilibrium.the numbers of nucleons and antinucleons were high—roughly as many as therewere electrons, positrons, or photons.
	but as the universe expanded and cooled,and the average kinetic energy of particles dropped below about 1 gev, which isthe minimum energy needed in a typical collision to create nucleons and anti-nucleons (about 940 mev each), the process of nucleon creation could not continue.p + o s photons or leptons.s n + n. photons s p + o10–6l101232ke l kt la1.4 * 10–23 j�kba1015 kb1.6 * 10–19 j�evl 1011 ev = 100 gev.101510–12ke = 32 kt10–3210–35section 33–7971†it may be interesting to point out that this story of origins here bears some resemblance to ancientaccounts (nonscientific) that mention the “void,”“formless wasteland” (or “darkness over the deep”),“abyss,”“divide the waters” (phase transition?

	the temperature had dropped to about corresponding to an aver-age kinetic energy where nucleons could strike each other and beable to fuse (section 31–3), but now cool enough so newly formed nuclei wouldnot be immediately broken apart by subsequent collisions.
