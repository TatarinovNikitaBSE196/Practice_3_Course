	section 2–2average velocity23c a u t i o nthe displacement may not equal thetotal distance traveledwe need to make a distinction between the distance an object has traveledand its displacement, which is defined as the change in position of the object.
	forone-dimensional motion along the x axis, a vector pointing to the right is positive, whereas a vector pointing to the left has a negative sign.exercise a an ant starts aton a piece of graph paper and walks alongthe x axis toit then turns around and walks back todetermine (a) the ant’s displacement and (b) the total distance traveled.2–2 average velocityan important aspect of the motion of a moving object is how fast it is moving—its speed or velocity.the term “speed” refers to how far an object travels in a given time interval,regardless of direction.
	if a car travels 240 kilometers (km) in 3 hours (h), we sayits average speed was in general, the average speed of an object isdefined as the total distance traveled along its path divided by the time it takes totravel this distance:(2;1)the terms “velocity” and “speed” are often used interchangeably in ordi-nary language.
	velocity, on the other hand, is used tosignify both the magnitude (numerical value) of how fast an object is movingand also the direction in which it is moving.
	velocity is therefore a vector.average speed = distance traveledtime elapsed.80 km�h.x = –10 cm.x = –20 cm.x = 20 cm¢x = x2 - x1 = 10.0 m - 30.0 m =–20.0 m,x2 = 10.0 m.x1 = 30.0 m¢x = x2 - x1 = 30.0 m - 10.0 m = 20.0 m,x2 = 30.0 m,x1 = 10.0 m¢x¢¢x = x2 - x1 ,x2 - x1 ,x2 .t2 ,x1t1 ,yxx2x1100203040distance (m)�xx070 mwesteast40 mdisplacement30 myfigure 2;4 a person walks 70 m east, then 30 m west.

	there is a second difference between speed and velocity: namely, the averagevelocity is defined in terms of displacement, rather than total distance traveled:average speed and average velocity have the same magnitude when themotion is all in one direction.
	then the average speed was:the magnitude of the average velocity, on the other hand, was:to discuss one-dimensional motion of an object in general, suppose that atsome moment in time, call it the object is on the x axis at position in acoordinate system, and at some later time,suppose it is at position theelapsed time (in time) isduring this time interval thedisplacement of our object isthen the average velocity,defined as the displacement divided by the elapsed time, can be written[average velocity](2;2)where stands for velocity and the bar over the is a standard symbolmeaning “average.”for one-dimensional motion in the usual case of the axis to the right,note that if is less than the object is moving to the left, and thenis less than zero.
	the sign of the displacement, and thus of theaverage velocity, indicates the direction: the average velocity is positive for anobject moving to the right along the axis and negative when the object moves to the left.
	the direction of the average velocity is always the same as the direction of the displacement.it is always important to choose (and state) the elapsed time, or time interval,the time that passes during our chosen period of observation.runner’s average velocity.

	to describe this situation we need theconcept of instantaneous velocity, which is the velocity at any instant of time.
	)more precisely, the instantaneous velocity at any moment is defined as theaverage velocity over an infinitesimally short time interval.
	we canwrite the definition of instantaneous velocity,for one-dimensional motion as[instantaneous velocity](2;3)the notationmeans the ratiois to be evaluated in the limit ofapproaching zero.†for instantaneous velocity we use the symbol whereas for averagevelocity we use with a bar above.
	in the rest of this book, when we use theterm “velocity” it will refer to instantaneous velocity.
	when we want to speak ofthe average velocity, we will make this clear by including the word “average.”note that the instantaneous speed always equals the magnitude of theinstantaneous velocity.
	because distance traveled and the magnitude ofthe displacement become the same when they become infinitesimally small.if an object moves at a uniform (that is, constant) velocity during a partic-ular time interval, then its instantaneous velocity at any instant is the same as itsaverage velocity (see fig.

	26chapter 2describing motion: kinematics in one dimension2–4 accelerationan object whose velocity is changing is said to be accelerating.
	for instance, a carwhose velocity increases in magnitude from zero to is accelerating.acceleration specifies how rapidly the velocity of an object is changing.average acceleration is defined as the change in velocity divided by the time taken to make this change:in symbols, the average acceleration,, over a time intervalduringwhich the velocity changes byis defined as[average acceleration](2;4)we saw that velocity is a vector (it has magnitude and direction), so accelerationis a vector too.
	)the instantaneous acceleration, a, can be defined in analogy to instantaneousvelocity as the average acceleration over an infinitesimally short time interval ata given instant:[instantaneous acceleration](2;5)here is the very small change in velocity during the very short time interval ¢t.¢va =lim¢t s 0¢v¢t.–±,a = v2 - v1t2 - t1=¢v¢t.¢v = v2 - v1 ,¢t = t2 - t1,aaverage acceleration = change of velocitytime elapsed.80 km�haccelerationa =  15 km/hsv1 =  0t1 =  0at t =  2.0 s    v =  30 km/hat t =  1.0 s    v =  15 km/hat t = t2 =  5.0 s    v = v2 =  75 km/hfigure 2;10 example 2–4.
	the caris shown at the start withatthe car is shown three moretimes, atand atthe end of our time interval,the green arrows represent thevelocity vectors, whose length represents the magnitude of thevelocity at that moment.
	what is the magnitude of its average acceleration?approach average acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the elapsedtime, 5.0 s. the car starts from rest, so the final velocity is .solution from eq.
	2–4, the average acceleration isthis is read as “fifteen kilometers per hour per second” and means that, onaverage, the velocity changed by 15 km h during each second.
	that is, assumingthe acceleration was constant, during the first second the car’s velocity increasedfrom zero to 15 km h. during the next second its velocity increased by another15 km h, reaching a velocity of 30 km h atand so on.



47

	to do so we can change km h to m s(see section 1–6, and example 1–5):thenwe almost always write the units for acceleration as (meters persecond squared) instead of this is possible because:note that acceleration tells us how quickly the velocity changes, whereasvelocity tells us how quickly the position changes.m�ss=ms�s = ms2 .m�s�s.m�s2a = 21 m�s - 0.0 m�s5.0 s= 4.2 m�ss= 4.2 ms2 .75 km�h =a 75 kmhb a 1000 m1 km b a 1 h3600 s b= 21 m�s.��velocity and acceleration.
	(a) if the velocityof an object is zero, does it mean that the acceleration is zero?
	(b) if theacceleration is zero, does it mean that the velocity is zero?
	think of some examples.response a zero velocity does not necessarily mean that the accelerationis zero, nor does a zero acceleration mean that the velocity is zero.
	(a) forexample, when you put your foot on the gas pedal of your car which is at rest,the velocity starts from zero but the acceleration is not zero since the velocityof the car changes.
	(how else could your car start forward if its velocity weren’tchanging—that is, accelerating?)

	if the initial velocity (when the driver hits the brakes) isand it takes 5.0 s to slow down towhat was the car’s average acceleration?approach we put the given initial and final velocities, and the elapsedtime, into eq.
	2–4, we call the initial timeand setthe negative sign appears because the final velocity is less than the initial velocity.in this case the direction of the acceleration is to the left (in the negative x direc-tion)—even though the velocity is always pointing to the right.
	thevelocity of an object moving to the right along the positive x axis is positive;if the object is slowing down (as in fig.
	we have a decelera-tion whenever the magnitude of the velocity is decreasing; thus the velocityand acceleration point in opposite directions when there is deceleration.exercise c a car moves along the x axis.



48

	in this case, the instantaneous and average accelerations are equal.we use the definitions of average velocity and acceleration to derive a set ofvaluable equations that relate x,a, andwhen a is constant, allowing us todetermine any one of these variables if we know the others.
	the initial position and the initial velocity of an objectwill now be represented by and since they represent x and atattime the position and velocity will be called x and (rather than and ).the average velocity during the time intervalwill be (eq.

	2–6 for obtaining (see appendix a–4 for a quick review)and substituting this into the previous equation we havewe solve this for and obtain[constant acceleration](2;10)which is the other useful equation we sought.we now have four equations relating position, velocity, acceleration, andtime, when the acceleration a is constant.



51

	we can check the reasonableness of the answer by doing an alternate calcu-lation: we first find the final velocityand then find the distance traveled which checks with our given distance.9.

	for a dry road and good tires, good brakes can decelerate a car at a rate of about tocalculate the total stopping distance for an initial velocity of and assume the acceleration of the car is(the minus sign appears because the velocity is taken to be in the positive x direction and its magnitude is decreasing).

	however, air resistancewill be noticeable even on a reasonably heavy object if the velocity becomeslarge.† acceleration due to gravity is a vector, as is any acceleration, and itsdirection is downward toward the center of the earth.when dealing with freely falling objects we can make use of eqs.
	if the object fallsfar enough, it will reach a maximum velocity called the terminal velocity due to air resistance.34chapter 2describing motion: kinematics in one dimension(a)(b)40302010y (m)2013t (s)y = 0y3 = 44.1 m(after 3.00 s)y2 = 19.6 m(after 2.00 s)y1 = 4.90 m(after 1.00 s)+yaccelerationdue togravity+yfigure 2;22 example 2–10.

	3–5 projectile motionin chapter 2, we studied the one-dimensional motion of an object in terms of dis-placement, velocity, and acceleration, including purely vertical motion of a fallingobject undergoing acceleration due to gravity.
	for convenience, we assume that the motion begins attimeat the origin of an xy coordinate system (so).let us look at a (tiny) ball rolling off the end of a horizontal table with an initial velocity in the horizontal (x) direction,see fig.
	the velocity vector at each instantpoints in the direction of the ball’s motion at that instant and is thus always tangentto the path.
	following galileo’s ideas, we treat the horizontal and vertical compo-nents of velocity and acceleration separately, and we can apply the kinematicequations (eqs.
	at the instant the ball leaves the table’s topit has only an x component of velocity.once the ball leaves the table (at), it experiences a vertically downwardacceleration g, the acceleration due to gravity.

	withthe horizontal component of velocity,remains constant, equal to its initial value,and thus has the same magnitudeat each point on the path.
	the horizontal displacement (with) is given bythe two vector components,and can be addedvectorially at any instant to obtain the velocity at that time (that is, for eachpoint on the path), as shown in fig.

	3–20, the analysis issimilar, except that now there is an initial vertical component of velocity,because of the downward acceleration of gravity, the upward component ofvelocity gradually decreases with time until the object reaches the highestpoint on its path, at which pointsubsequently the object moves down-ward (fig.
	if air resistance is neglected, will the apple land(a) behind the wagon, (b) in the wagon, or (c) in front of the wagon?response the child throws the apple straight up from her own reference framewith initial velocity (fig.
	but when viewed by someone on the ground,the apple also has an initial horizontal component of velocity equal to the speed ofthe wagon,thus, to a person on the ground, the apple will follow the path ofa projectile as shown in fig.
	as theapple follows its arc, the wagon will be directly under the apple at all timesbecause they have the same horizontal velocity.

	section 3–8relative velocity653–8 relative velocitywe now consider how observations made in different frames of reference arerelated to each other.
	observers on the earthbeside the train tracks will measure for the speed of each of the trains.observers on either one of the trains (a different frame of reference) will mea-sure a speed of for the train approaching them.similarly, when one car traveling passes a second car traveling inthe same direction at the first car has a speed relative to the second carofwhen the velocities are along the same line, simple addition or subtraction issufficient to obtain the relative velocity.
	we emphasize, as mentioned in section 2–1, thatwhen specifying a velocity, it is important to specify what the reference frame is.when determining relative velocity, it is easy to make a mistake by addingor subtracting the wrong velocities.
	each velocity is labeled by two subscripts:the first refers to the object, the second to the reference frame in which it has thisvelocity.
	we let be the velocity of the boat with respect to the water.
	(this is also what the boat’s velocity would be relative to the shore if the water were still.)
	similarly,is the velocity of the boat with respect to the shore,and is the velocity of the water with respect to the shore (this is the rivercurrent).
	note that is what the boat’s motor produces (against the water),whereas is equal to plus the effect of the current,therefore, thevelocity of the boat relative to the shore is (see vector diagram, fig.
	for example, if a fisherman on the boat walks with a velocity rela-tive to the boat, his velocity relative to the shore is  theequations involving relative velocity will be correct when adjacent inner subscriptsare identical and when the outermost ones correspond exactly to the two on thevelocity on the left of the equation.
	but this works only with plus signs (on theright), not minus signs.it is often useful to remember that for any two objects or reference frames,a and b, the velocity of a relative to b has the same magnitude, but oppositedirection, as the velocity of b relative to a:(3;8)for example, if a train is traveling relative to the earth in a certaindirection, objects on the earth (such as trees) appear to an observer on the trainto be traveling in the opposite direction.100 km�h100 km�hvbba =–vbab .vbfs = vbfb + vbbw + vbws.vbfbvbbs.vbbs = vbbw + vbws.vbws.vbbwvbbsvbbwvbwsvbbsvbbw90 km�h - 75 km�h = 15 km�h.75 km�h,90 km�h160 km�h80 km�h80 km�h†we thus can see, for example, that the equation  is wrong: the inner subscriptsare not the same, and the outer ones on the right do not correspond to the subscripts on the left.vbbw = vbbs + vbwsenwsbsbwwsvbvbvbθriver currentfigure 3;28 a boat heads northdirectly across a river which flowswest.

96

	we have discussed how motion is described in terms of velocity andacceleration.
	onthe other hand, we say that an object falls because of the force of gravity (which isnot a contact force).if an object is at rest, to start it moving requires force—that is, a force isneeded to accelerate an object from zero velocity to a nonzero velocity.
	for anobject already moving, if you want to change its velocity—either in direction or inmagnitude—a force is required.
	force has direc-tion as well as magnitude, and is indeed a vector that follows the rules of vectoraddition discussed in chapter 3. we can represent any force on a diagram by anarrow, just as we did with velocity.
	furthermore, aristotle argued,the greater the force on the object, the greater its speed.some 2000 years later, galileo disagreed: he maintained that it is just as naturalfor an object to be in motion with a constant velocity as it is for it to be at rest.



97

	this is consistent with galileo’s viewpoint, for theobject moves with constant velocity when no net force is exerted on it.upon this foundation laid by galileo, isaac newton (fig.
	it states thatevery object continues in its state of rest, or of uniform velocity in a straightline, as long as no net force acts on it.the tendency of an object to maintain its state of rest or of uniform velocity in astraight line is called inertia.
	by newton’s first law, the backpackscontinue their state of motion, maintaining their velocity.
	for example, if yourreference frame is an accelerating car, an object such as a cup resting on the dashboard may begin to move toward you (it stayed at rest as long as the car’svelocity remained constant).



98

	any reference frame that moves with constant velocity (say, a car or an air-plane) relative to an inertial frame is also an inertial reference frame.
	it is harder to startit moving from rest, or to stop it when it is moving, or to change its velocity sidewaysout of a straight-line path.
	a truck has much more inertia than a baseball movingat the same speed, and a much greater force is needed to change the truck’svelocity at the same rate as the ball’s.
	but what happens if a net force is exerted on an object?newton perceived that the object’s velocity will change (fig.
	a net forceexerted on an object may make its velocity increase.
	or, if the net force is in adirection opposite to the motion, that force will reduce the object’s velocity.
	if thenet force acts sideways on a moving object, the direction of the object’s velocitychanges.
	that change in the direction of the velocity is also an acceleration.



100

	we aregiven the initial velocity (section 1–6), the finalvelocity  and the distance traveled  from eq.
	2–11c, wehavesothe net force required is thenor the force must be exerted in the direction opposite to the initialvelocity, which is what the negative sign means.note if the acceleration is not precisely constant, then we are determining an“average” acceleration and we obtain an “average” net force.newton’s second law, like the first law, is valid only in inertial reference frames(section 4–2).

	a hockey puck is sliding at constant velocity across a flat horizontal ice surface that is assumed to be frictionless.
	no net forceacts on the puck, and the puck slides at constant velocity across the ice.in the real world, where even smooth ice exerts at least a tiny friction force,then (c) is the correct answer.

113

	we focus now on sliding friction, which is usually called kinetic friction(kinetic is from the greek for “moving”).when an object slides along a rough surface, the force of kinetic friction actsopposite to the direction of the object’s velocity.



118

	newton’s three laws of motion are the basic classical lawsdescribing motion.newton’s first law (the law of inertia) states that if the netforce on an object is zero, an object originally at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion in a straightline with constant velocity.newton’s second law states that the acceleration of anobject is directly proportional to the net force acting on it, andinversely proportional to its mass:(4;1)newton’s second law is one of the most important and funda-mental laws in classical physics.newton’s third law states that whenever one object exertsa force on a second object, the second object always exerts aforce on the first object which is equal in magnitude but oppo-site in direction:(4;2)where is the force on object b exerted by object a.the tendency of an object to resist a change in its motionis called inertia.

	]to summarize, an object moving in a circle of radius r at constant speed v hasan acceleration whose direction is toward the center of the circle and whose magni-tude is it is not surprising that this acceleration depends on v and r.the greater the speed v, the faster the velocity changes direction; and the larger theradius, the less rapidly the velocity changes direction.the acceleration vector points toward the center of the circle when v is con-stant.
	but the velocity vector always points in the direction of motion, which istangential to the circle.
	thus the velocity and acceleration vectors are perpen-dicular to each other at every point in the path for uniform circular motion (fig.

232

	an object rotating about an axis is said to have rotational kinetic energy.by analogy with translational kinetic energy, we might expect this to be given by the expression where i is the moment of inertia of the object and is its angular velocity.

	it is called angular momentum, l.for a symmetrical object rotating about a fixed axis through the cm, the angularmomentum is(8;18)where i is the moment of inertia and is the angular velocity about the axis ofrotation.
	if an object has angular velocity at time and angular velocity after a time interval then its angular acceleration (eq.
	this is the law of conservation of angular momentum fora rotating object:the total angular momentum of a rotating object remains constant if the nettorque acting on it is zero.the law of conservation of angular momentum is one of the great conservationlaws of physics, along with those for energy and linear momentum.when there is zero net torque acting on an object, and the object is rotatingabout a fixed axis or about an axis through its center of mass whose directiondoesn’t change, we can write(8;20)and are the moment of inertia and angular velocity, respectively, about thataxis at some initial time and i and are their values at some other time.the parts of the object may alter their positions relative to one another, so that ichanges.



236

	since the angular momentum remains constant(we ignore the small torque due to friction), if i decreases, then the angularvelocity must increase.

	rotating or otherwiseaccelerating frames of reference are noninertial frames,‡ and won’t concern us inthis chapter (they are dealt with in einstein’s general theory of relativity, as wewill see in chapter 33).a reference frame that moves with constant velocity with respect to aninertial frame is itself also an inertial frame, since newton’s laws hold in it as well.when we say that we observe or make measurements from a certain referenceframe, it means that we are at rest in that reference frame.

	the mass of an object, as well as all forces,are assumed to be unchanged by a change in inertial reference frame.the position of an object, however, is different when specified in differentreference frames, and so is velocity.

	maxwell’s equations gave thevelocity of light c as and this is just what is measured.
	for example, if observers could travel on a rocket ship at a speed of away from a source of light, wemight expect them to measure the speed of the light reaching them to be but maxwell’s equationshave no provision for relative velocity.
	nineteenth-century physicists viewed the material world in terms of the laws of mechanics, soit was natural for them to assume that light too must travel in some medium.they called this transparent medium the ether and assumed it permeated all space.‡it was therefore assumed that the velocity of light given by maxwell’s equationsmust be with respect to the ether.§scientists soon set out to determine the speed of the earth relative to thisabsolute frame, whatever it might be.
	for just as a boat has different speeds relative to the land when it movesupstream, downstream, or across the stream, so too light would be expected tohave different speeds depending on the velocity of the ether past the earth.strange as it may seem, they detected no difference at all.
	in any otherreference frame, extra terms were needed to account for relative velocity.



768

	the first was an extension of the galilean–newtonian relativity principle to include not only the laws ofmechanics but also those of the rest of physics, including electricity and magnetism:first postulate (the relati£ity principle): the laws of physics have the sameform in all inertial reference frames.the first postulate can also be stated as: there is no experiment you can do in aninertial reference frame to determine if you are at rest or moving uniformly atconstant velocity.the second postulate is consistent with the first:second postulate (constancy of the speed of light): light propagates throughempty space with a definite speed c independent of the speed of the source orobserver.these two postulates form the foundation of einstein’s special theory of relativity.it is called “special” to distinguish it from his later “general theory of relativity,”which deals with noninertial (accelerating) reference frames (chapter 33).
	this conflicts with oureveryday experience: we would expect to have to add in the velocity of the observer.on the other hand, perhaps we can’t expect our everyday experience to be helpful when dealing with the high velocity of light.

	what the uncertainty principle really tells us is that if we insist on thinkingof the electron as a particle, then there are certain limitations on this simplifiedview—namely, that the position and velocity cannot both be known precisely atthe same time; and even that the electron does not have a precise position andmomentum at the same time (because it is not simply a particle).

	28–4 philosophic implications;probability versus determinismthe classical newtonian view of the world is a deterministic one (see section 5–8).one of its basic ideas is that once the position and velocity of an object areknown at a particular time, its future position can be predicted if the forces on itare known.
	for example, if a stone is thrown a number of times with the sameinitial velocity and angle, and the forces on it remain the same, the path of theprojectile will always be the same.
	this is very different from the classical view, inwhich the path of a particle is precisely predictable from the initial position andvelocity and the forces exerted on it.
	according to quantum mechanics, the positionand velocity of an object cannot even be known accurately at the same time.this is expressed in the uncertainty principle, and arises because basic entities,such as electrons, are not considered simply as particles: they have wave propertiesas well.

	in his generaltheory of relativity, einstein developed a theory of gravity that now forms thebasis of cosmological dynamics.in the special theory of relativity (chapter 26), einstein concluded that thereis no way for an observer to determine whether a given frame of reference is atrest or is moving at constant velocity in a straight line.

	if a light beam is emitted by a flashlight attached to the side of theelevator, the beam travels straight across the elevator and makes a spot on theopposite side if the elevator is at rest or moving at constant velocity (fig.

	the doppler effectoccurs also for light, but the formula for light is slightly different than for soundand is given by†(33;3)where is the emitted wavelength as seen in a reference frame at rest withrespect to the source, and is the wavelength observed in a frame moving withvelocity away from the source along the line of sight.
	that is, thevelocity of a galaxy moving away from us is proportional to its distance d from us:(33;4)this is hubble’s law, one of the most fundamental astronomical ideas.

	but for more distant galaxies, the velocity of recession is muchgreater than the velocity of local random motion, and so is dominant and hubble’slaw (eq.
	more distant galaxies have higher recessionvelocity and a larger redshift, and we call their redshift a cosmological redshift.we interpret this redshift today as due to the expansion of space itself.

	to observers on the ground, this is all very clear: the ball has an initial velocity when it is released (because the platform ismoving), and it simply continues moving in a straight-line path as shown in fig.

	the woman at athrows a ball with a horizontal velocity (in her reference frame) radially outwardtoward the man at b on the outer edge of the platform.
	the ball initially has not only thevelocity radially outward, but also a tangential velocity due to the rotation of the platform.
	both a and b are at rest, and the ball is thrown with velocity toward b,but the ball deflects to the right as shown and passes behind b as previouslydescribed.

	2–11b),for a constant acceleration (with zero ini-tial velocity in the y direction).
	c–1 in the formwe see that the coriolis accelerationis(c–2)this relation is valid for any velocity in the plane of rotation perpendicular to theaxis of rotation (in fig.

	for example,a monatomic gas has three degrees of freedom, because an atom can have velocityalong the x, y, and z axes.

	let the components of its velocity vector in be and .
	(we use u to distinguish it from the relative velocity of the two frames, v.) nowand where all quantities are asmeasured in the frame.
	for example, if at time the particle is at and ashort time later,it is at thenthe velocity of p as seen from s will have components and we can show how these are related to the velocity components in by usingeqs.
	for example,for the other components,and so we have[galilean] (e;2)these are known as the galilean velocity transformation equations.
	we see thatthe y and z components of velocity are unchanged, but the x components differby v. this is just what we have used before when dealing with relative velocity(section 3–8).



1027

	notice that not only is the x equa-tion modified as compared to the galilean transformation, but so is the equation.indeed, we see directly in this last equation how the space and time coordinates mix.the relativistically correct velocity equations are obtained using eqs.e–3(we let ) and the others are obtained in the same way, and we collect them here:(e;4)the first of these equations is eq.
	26–11, which we used in section 26–10 wherewe discussed how velocities do not add in our commonsense (galilean) way,because of the denominator we can now also see that the y and zcomponents of velocity are also altered and that they depend on the compo-nent of velocity.x¿a1 + vuxœ �c2b.uz =uzœ 31 - v2�c21 + vuxœ �c2.uy =uyœ 31 - v2�c21 + vuxœ �c2ux =uxœ + v1 + vuxœ �c2=uœx + v1 + vuœx�c2 .ux =¢x¢t=ga¢x¿ + v ¢t¿bga¢t¿ + v ¢x¿�c2b =a¢x¿�¢t¿b + v1 + av�c2ba¢x¿�¢t¿bux = ¢x�¢t, u¿x = ¢x¿�¢t¿:g = 1�21 - v2�c2tt =131 - v2�c2 ¢t¿ + vx¿c2 ≤.z = z¿y = y¿x =131 - v2�c2 ax¿ + vt¿bt = gat¿ + vx¿�c2b.tx¿ = g(x - vt) = gcgax¿ + vt¿b - vtd.x = gax¿ + vt¿b:x¿ = g(x - vt)t¿.tg,ggg =131 - v2�c2 .gtg2ac2 - v2bt�c.ct = g(c + v)g(c - v)(t�c) =t¿ = g(c - v)(t�c),ct¿ = x¿ = g(ct - vt) = g(c - v)t.ct = x = gact¿ + vt¿b = g(c + v)t¿,s¿x¿ = ct¿x = ctta-24appendix egalilean and lorentz transformationslorentztransformationsrelativistic velocitytransformations
