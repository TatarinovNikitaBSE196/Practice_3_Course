	26chapter 2describing motion: kinematics in one dimension2–4 accelerationan object whose velocity is changing is said to be accelerating.
	for instance, a carwhose velocity increases in magnitude from zero to is accelerating.acceleration specifies how rapidly the velocity of an object is changing.average acceleration is defined as the change in velocity divided by the time taken to make this change:in symbols, the average acceleration,, over a time intervalduringwhich the velocity changes byis defined as[average acceleration](2;4)we saw that velocity is a vector (it has magnitude and direction), so accelerationis a vector too.
	but for one dimensional motion, we need only use a plus or minussign to indicate acceleration direction relative to a chosen coordinate axis.
	)the instantaneous acceleration, a, can be defined in analogy to instantaneousvelocity as the average acceleration over an infinitesimally short time interval ata given instant:[instantaneous acceleration](2;5)here is the very small change in velocity during the very short time interval ¢t.¢va =lim¢t s 0¢v¢t.–±,a = v2 - v1t2 - t1=¢v¢t.¢v = v2 - v1 ,¢t = t2 - t1,aaverage acceleration = change of velocitytime elapsed.80 km�haccelerationa =  15 km/hsv1 =  0t1 =  0at t =  2.0 s    v =  30 km/hat t =  1.0 s    v =  15 km/hat t = t2 =  5.0 s    v = v2 =  75 km/hfigure 2;10 example 2–4.

	what is the magnitude of its average acceleration?approach average acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the elapsedtime, 5.0 s. the car starts from rest, so the final velocity is .solution from eq.
	2–4, the average acceleration isthis is read as “fifteen kilometers per hour per second” and means that, onaverage, the velocity changed by 15 km h during each second.
	that is, assumingthe acceleration was constant, during the first second the car’s velocity increasedfrom zero to 15 km h. during the next second its velocity increased by another15 km h, reaching a velocity of 30 km h atand so on.

	section 2–4acceleration27our result in example 2–4 contains two different time units: hours and seconds.we usually prefer to use only seconds.
	to do so we can change km h to m s(see section 1–6, and example 1–5):thenwe almost always write the units for acceleration as (meters persecond squared) instead of this is possible because:note that acceleration tells us how quickly the velocity changes, whereasvelocity tells us how quickly the position changes.m�ss=ms�s = ms2 .m�s�s.m�s2a = 21 m�s - 0.0 m�s5.0 s= 4.2 m�ss= 4.2 ms2 .75 km�h =a 75 kmhb a 1000 m1 km b a 1 h3600 s b= 21 m�s.��velocity and acceleration.
	(a) if the velocityof an object is zero, does it mean that the acceleration is zero?
	(b) if theacceleration is zero, does it mean that the velocity is zero?
	think of some examples.response a zero velocity does not necessarily mean that the accelerationis zero, nor does a zero acceleration mean that the velocity is zero.
	(a) forexample, when you put your foot on the gas pedal of your car which is at rest,the velocity starts from zero but the acceleration is not zero since the velocityof the car changes.

	if the initial velocity (when the driver hits the brakes) isand it takes 5.0 s to slow down towhat was the car’s average acceleration?approach we put the given initial and final velocities, and the elapsedtime, into eq.
	2–4, we call the initial timeand setthe negative sign appears because the final velocity is less than the initial velocity.in this case the direction of the acceleration is to the left (in the negative x direc-tion)—even though the velocity is always pointing to the right.
	we say that theacceleration is to the left, and it is shown in fig.
	but be careful:deceleration does not mean that the acceleration is necessarily negative.
	2–11), the acceleration is negative.
	butthe same car moving to the left (decreasing x), and slowing down, has positiveacceleration that points to the right, as shown in fig.
	we have a decelera-tion whenever the magnitude of the velocity is decreasing; thus the velocityand acceleration point in opposite directions when there is deceleration.exercise c a car moves along the x axis.

	2–5 motion at constant accelerationwe now examine motion in a straight line when the magnitude of the accelerationis constant.
	in this case, the instantaneous and average accelerations are equal.we use the definitions of average velocity and acceleration to derive a set ofvaluable equations that relate x,a, andwhen a is constant, allowing us todetermine any one of these variables if we know the others.
	2–2)since we chosethe acceleration, assumed constant in time, is(eq.
	2–4), soa common problem is to determine the velocity of an object after any elapsedtime when we are given the object’s constant acceleration.
	we can solve suchproblems† by solving for in the last equation: first we multiply both sides by ,then, adding to both sides, we obtain[constant acceleration](2;6)if an object, such as a motorcycle (fig.
	2–13), starts from restandaccelerates at after an elapsed timeits velocity will benext, let us see how to calculate the position x of an object after a time whenit undergoes constant acceleration.

	2–7,or[constant acceleration](2;9)equations 2–6, 2–8, and 2–9 are three of the four most useful equations formotion at constant acceleration.

	2–6 for obtaining (see appendix a–4 for a quick review)and substituting this into the previous equation we havewe solve this for and obtain[constant acceleration](2;10)which is the other useful equation we sought.we now have four equations relating position, velocity, acceleration, andtime, when the acceleration a is constant.

	for a dry road and good tires, good brakes can decelerate a car at a rate of about tocalculate the total stopping distance for an initial velocity of and assume the acceleration of the car is(the minus sign appears because the velocity is taken to be in the positive x direction and its magnitude is decreasing).



53

	for free fall, he postulated that all objects wouldfall with the same constant acceleration in the absence of air or other resistance.he showed that this postulate predicts that for an object falling from rest, thedistance traveled will be proportional to the square of the time (fig.
	in a chamber from which the air has been removed, even lightobjects like a feather or a horizontally held piece of paper will fall with thesame acceleration as any other object (see fig.



54

	galileo’s specific contribution to our understanding of the motion of fallingobjects can be summarized as follows:at a given location on the earth and in the absence of air resistance, allobjects fall with the same constant acceleration.we call this acceleration the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of theearth, and we give it the symbol g. its magnitude is approximatelyin british units g is about actually, g varies slightly according to lati-tude and elevation on the earth’s surface, but these variations are so small thatwe will ignore them for most purposes.
	(acceleration of gravity in space beyondthe earth’s surface is treated in chapter 5.)
	however, air resistancewill be noticeable even on a reasonably heavy object if the velocity becomeslarge.† acceleration due to gravity is a vector, as is any acceleration, and itsdirection is downward toward the center of the earth.when dealing with freely falling objects we can make use of eqs.
	how far will it have fallen after a time  and  ignore air resistance.approach let us take y as positive downward, so the acceleration iswe set  and  we want to find the posi-tion y of the ball after three different time intervals.
	if the object fallsfar enough, it will reach a maximum velocity called the terminal velocity due to air resistance.34chapter 2describing motion: kinematics in one dimension(a)(b)40302010y (m)2013t (s)y = 0y3 = 44.1 m(after 3.00 s)y2 = 19.6 m(after 2.00 s)y1 = 4.90 m(after 1.00 s)+yaccelerationdue togravity+yfigure 2;22 example 2–10.

	in the absence of air resistance, thepath would be a perfect parabola.the gold arrow represents the downward acceleration of gravity,galileo analyzed themotion of objects in 2 dimensionsunder the action of gravity near the earth’s surface (now called “projectile motion”) into its horizontal and vertical components.we will discuss vectors and how to add them.



78

	3–5 projectile motionin chapter 2, we studied the one-dimensional motion of an object in terms of dis-placement, velocity, and acceleration, including purely vertical motion of a fallingobject undergoing acceleration due to gravity.
	following galileo’s ideas, we treat the horizontal and vertical compo-nents of velocity and acceleration separately, and we can apply the kinematicequations (eqs.
	at the instant the ball leaves the table’s topit has only an x component of velocity.once the ball leaves the table (at), it experiences a vertically downwardacceleration g, the acceleration due to gravity.
	then the acceleration due to gravityis in the direction, so from eq.



79

	in the horizontal direction, on the other hand, there is no acceleration (we areignoring air resistance).
	3–20, the analysis issimilar, except that now there is an initial vertical component of velocity,because of the downward acceleration of gravity, the upward component ofvelocity gradually decreases with time until the object reaches the highestpoint on its path, at which pointsubsequently the object moves down-ward (fig.

	we have discussed how motion is described in terms of velocity andacceleration.



98

	the more mass an object has,the greater the force needed to give it a particular acceleration.
	that change in the direction of the velocity is also an acceleration.
	if you triple the force, the acceleration is tripled,and so on.
	thus, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional† to the netapplied force.



99

	the greater the mass, the less the acceleration for the same net force.
	the mathe-matical relation, as newton argued, is that the acceleration of an object is inverselyproportional to its mass.
	these relationships are found to hold in general and canbe summarized as follows:the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force actingon it, and is inversely proportional to the object’s mass.
	)in si units, with the mass in kilograms, the unit of force is called the newton (n).one newton is the force required to impart an acceleration of to a mass of 1 kg.
	the unit of force is the dyne, whichis defined as the net force needed to impart an acceleration of to a massof 1 g. thus  because  and  then  in the british system, which we rarely use, the unit of force is the pound(abbreviated lb), where  the unit of mass is the slug,which is defined as that mass which will undergo an acceleration of when a force of 1 lb is applied to it.

	2–11c, wehavesothe net force required is thenor the force must be exerted in the direction opposite to the initialvelocity, which is what the negative sign means.note if the acceleration is not precisely constant, then we are determining an“average” acceleration and we obtain an “average” net force.newton’s second law, like the first law, is valid only in inertial reference frames(section 4–2).

	to determine if the assistant moves or not, we must consider only the forces on the assistant and then apply  where is the net forceon the assistant,is the acceleration of the assistant, and m is the assistant’s mass.there are two forces on the assistant that affect his forward motion; they areshown as bright red (magenta) arrows in figs.4–12 and 4–13: they are (1) the hori-zontal force exerted on the assistant by the ground (the harder he pushesbackward against the ground, the harder the ground pushes forward on him—newton’s third law), and (2) the force exerted on the assistant by the sled,pulling backward on him; see fig.

	for the acceleration,we use the downward acceleration due togravity,thus, the gravitational force on an object,can be written as(4;3)the direction of this force is down toward the center of the earth.
	for exam-ple, on the moon the acceleration due to gravity is about one-sixth what it is onearth, and a 1.0-kg mass weighs only 1.6 n. although we will not use britishunits, we note that for practical purposes on the earth, a mass of 1.0 kg weighsabout 2.2 lb.

	because acceleration is defined as the rate of changeof velocity, a change in direction of velocity is an acceleration, just as a change inits magnitude is.
	we now investi-gate this acceleration quantitatively.acceleration is defined aswhere is the change in velocity during the short time interval we willeventually consider the situation in which approaches zero and thus obtainthe instantaneous acceleration.
	therefore, this acceleration is called centripetalacceleration (“center-pointing” acceleration) or radial acceleration (since it isdirected along the radius, toward the center of the circle), and we denote it by now that we have determined the direction, next we find the magnitude of theradial (centripetal) acceleration,because the line ca in fig.

	acceleration is[radial (centripetal) acceleration](5;1)[equation 5–1 is valid at any instant in circular motion, and even when v is notconstant.
	]to summarize, an object moving in a circle of radius r at constant speed v hasan acceleration whose direction is toward the center of the circle and whose magni-tude is it is not surprising that this acceleration depends on v and r.the greater the speed v, the faster the velocity changes direction; and the larger theradius, the less rapidly the velocity changes direction.the acceleration vector points toward the center of the circle when v is con-stant.
	thus the velocity and acceleration vectors are perpen-dicular to each other at every point in the path for uniform circular motion (fig.
	this is another example that illustrates the error in thinking that acceleration and velocity are always in the same direction.

	rather, it is the acceleration due to the earth’s gravity for any object(such as the moon) that is 384,000 km from the earth.
	that is, a net force is necessary to give it centripetal acceleration.
	themagnitude of the required force can be calculated using newton’s second law forthe radial component,where is the centripetal acceleration,and is the total (or net) force in the radial direction:[circular motion](5;3)for uniform circular motion the acceleration is which isdirected toward the center of the circle at all times.

	the force responsible for the acceleration may notbe obvious at first, since there seems to be no force pointing directly horizontally.but it is the net force (the sum of and here) that must point in the direction of the acceleration.

	5–15a, the force has two components.the component directed toward the center of the circle,gives rise to the cen-tripetal acceleration,and keeps the object moving in a circle.
	in athletics, a hammer throweraccelerates the hammer tangentially in a similar way so that it reaches a high speedbefore release.the tangential component of the acceleration,has magnitude equal tothe rate of change of the magnitude of the object’s velocity:the radial (centripetal) acceleration arises from the change in direction of thevelocity and, as we have seen (eq.

139

	the centripetal acceleration of the moon, as we calculatedin example 5–2, isin terms of the acceleration of gravity atthe earth’s surface,that is, the acceleration of the moon toward the earth is about as great as the acceleration of objects at the earth’s surface.
